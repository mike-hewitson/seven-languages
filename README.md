# Prolog notes
- Remember to always end a statement with a '.'
- The SWIPL version 7.2.3 compiler will return true/false instead of    yes/no.
- To avoid getting undefined method exception, you first need to run    dynamic command before calling methods in the file.
E.G. ?- dynamic fd_all_different/1.
